# Personal Notes on Ruby

by ...

## Setup

"bundle install" installs stuff, so bundle is a package manager for ruby,
like composer for php or npm for node.js. The output of bundler mentioned
"Gemfile", this seems to be the place to define which packages to install.
Another file, "Gemfile.lock" was created in the process. It contains more
packages, probably the dependencies.

"rake" seems could be a task runner like "make" or "npm run". Or it could
be the tool for running tests specifically. Too soon to tell.

## 00_hello

Functions are defined with `def`, arguments seem to
work the same as in Javascript.
